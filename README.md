# sup beaners this is the best language (h0rsescript)

Base syntax:
TARGET=EXECUTABLE code

Process runs in the ROOT object
```
ROOT.MEMORY
```
so basically the ROOT will have a object in it called MEMORY 
which will obv be storing the data
and in MEMORY lets say theres a function called CREATE
which allocates a free space in the MEMORY

Memory available:
[000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000]

Allocate some memory by
```
ROOT.MEMORY.CREATE=variables(500) //500 bytes
```

[00000000000000000000[here 500 bytes is free]0000000000000000000000000000000000000]

Create a object of type variable

```
ROOT.OBJECT.CREATE=var(name[variables] = str -> "loser")
```

***

## **OBJECT TYPES**
Here, the object of type `var()` is created
The following types of objects are available 
 
```
ill add later
``` 

## **DATA TYPES**
`>>` is used to specify the Datatype
The following data types are available in h0rsescript

1) Strings
2) Ints
3) Arrays

| Datatype  | Symbol |
| :-------: | :----: |
| `String`  | ->     |
| `Integer` | =>     |
| `Array`   | >>     |
